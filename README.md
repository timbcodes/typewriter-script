# typewriter-script
This is the typewriter script from my timb.codes portfolio page

## How to use:
- All you need to do is add the typewriter.js file to your project, and import it into the document or component you wish to use it in
- Once you've done this, all you need to do is instanciate a new Typewriter class in your project, and pass the arguments of (words, wait)
- Words takes an array of strings you wish to cycle through
- Wait is how long the text will stay up before cycling to the next word in the array
- Wait is set to 3000ms as a default
